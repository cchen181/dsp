### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path X
* creating a directory X
* deleting a directory X
* creating a file using `touch` command X
* deleting a file X
* renaming a file X
* listing hidden files X
* copying a file from one directory to another X

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > 'pwd' shows current working directory path ('print working directory')
'ls' lists files and directories within the current folder
'cd' change directory. It switches you into the directory you specify
'cd ..' moves you up a directory
'mkdir' creates a directory ('make directory')
'touch file.txt' creates a file.txt file using the 'touch' command
'cp directory/file.txt newdirectory/' copies file.txt from directory to newdirectory (i.e. copying a file from one directory to another)
'ls -a' lists hidden files and folders in current directory
'mv file.txt newfilename.txt' renames a file (renames file.txt to newfilename.txt)
'rm file.txt' deletes a file ('remove' file.txt)
'rm -r directory/' deletes a directory ('remove recursively', which deletes a directory and all its child directories)
